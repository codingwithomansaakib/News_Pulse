# 📰 News Pulse

News Pulse is a full-stack news aggregation and clustering platform that collects articles from multiple RSS feeds, extracts their content, groups similar news stories using Natural Language Processing (NLP), and presents them in an interactive dashboard.

The project automatically fetches the latest news from multiple trusted sources, stores them in MongoDB, clusters related articles using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity, and visualizes the results with a modern Next.js frontend.
